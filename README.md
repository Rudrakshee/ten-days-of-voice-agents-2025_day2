# ☕ AI Voice Barista Agent  
**AI Voice Agents Challenge – Day 2**

This project is part of the **10 Days of Voice Agents Challenge by Murf AI**.  
For Day 2, I built a **Coffee Shop Barista Voice Agent** that simulates a real café ordering experience.

---

## 🎧 Overview
The voice agent is designed to:

- Take coffee orders  
- Ask follow-up questions  
- Clarify preferences (sizes, types, customizations, etc.)  
- Remember user responses during the conversation  
- Respond with natural-sounding outputs powered by **Murf Falcon**

---

## 📸 Demo  
A demo video showing the agent in action is included in this repository.

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress  
Right now, this repository only includes the demo video.  
The following will be added soon:

- Frontend UI  
- Backend logic  
- Integration code and setup instructions

Stay tuned for updates! ☕🚀
